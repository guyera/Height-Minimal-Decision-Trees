Execute the script using the following syntax:

    python main.py "data filename" "labels filename"

The data file should contain CSV data, where each row is a data vector and all rows have identical numbers of entries.
The labels file should contain CSV data, where each row contains one entry indicating the binary label for the corresponding data vector.

Example: python main.py data/rand_d4_n16_data.csv data/rand_d4_n16_labels.csv
